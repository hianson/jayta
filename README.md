# What is this?
JAYTA is Just Another YouTube App created for educational purposes (specifically to learn some jazz guitar lines). I wanted to be able to search for and play YouTube videos with the ability to loop over a particular segment of that video, and even change the speed of that segment.

# User Interaction
You can search for videos using the search field, and then use the slider below the video to set the loop region of the selected video. The buttons can be used to change the play speed.

# Tech
JAYTA is built in React.js and utilizes YouTube's API for video searching, and changing the state of the video player. The awesome slider component was created by Ant Design, which can be found here: https://ant.design/components/slider/.
